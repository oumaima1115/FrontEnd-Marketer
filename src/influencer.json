During the morning demonstration at the Las Vegas airport, TSA officials compared the new program to self-checkout lanes at the supermarket. Instead of TSA officers ushering passengers through the two-step process, travelers will scan their own bags and themselves. This will allow them to set their own pace and minimize their interactions with TSA employees. The agency’s staff members will still check IDs and oversee secondary screenings of bags and pat-downs of passengers suspected of carrying banned items. Officials said the objective is not to accelerate screenings but to improve the passenger experience. (Photos by Amber Garrett for The Washington Post)",

                    "Would you eat food that’s been predigested? Experts say that’s what we’re doing when we consume many popular packaged foods — those breads, cereals, snack chips and frozen meals that have been refined, pounded, heated, melted, shaped, extruded and packed with additives. A growing body of research suggests that the extent of industrial processing that your food undergoes can alter its effects on your body, determining its impact on your appetite, hormones, weight gain, and likelihood of developing obesity and chronic diseases. This extreme processing creates foods that are so easily absorbed by the body that they’re essentially predigested. Many foods also are engineered to overcome our satiety mechanisms, which drives us to overeat and gain weight, experts say. In recent years, scientists have adopted a new name for foods that are intensely manipulated by food manufacturers: ultra-processed.",

Biden, who in recent weeks has dispatched top officials to the Middle East and Europe to push for a cease-fire, said Monday that he hoped such a pause could start as soon as next week. In a surprise appearance on late-night television, however, Biden appeared to preempt Israeli officials on the timeline. “There’s been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan … in order to give us time to get all the hostages out,” Biden said on the talk show “Late Night With Seth Meyers.” A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office declined to comment on Biden’s remarks.",

The shots erupted around 2 p.m. local time near the city’s stately Union Station, sending thousands of red-clad fans who had packed into downtown scrambling for safety as police responded with guns drawn. The violence forced emergency evacuations of the region’s top political leaders gathered for the parade and rally, including the governors of Missouri and Kansas and the mayor of Kansas City, who fled the shots with his wife and mother.

They are demanding a living wage that ensures drivers aren’t living in poverty, and transparency over how pay is calculated. They also want to end unfair deactivations — when a driver loses access to the platform, among other things.",

                    "Attorney General Kris Mayes today announced a lawsuit against RealPage, Inc. and nine major residential apartment landlords operating in Arizona for conspiring to illegally raise rents for hundreds of thousands of Arizona renters in the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas. RealPage is a software company that offers what it calls “revenue management” to its clients, including those named as its co-defendants in this lawsuit. “The conspiracy allegedly engaged in by RealPage and these landlords has harmed Arizonans and directly contributed to Arizona’s affordable housing crisis,” said Attorney General Mayes. “In the last two years, residential rents in Phoenix and Tucson have risen by at least 30% in large part because of this conspiracy that stifled fair competition and essentially established a rental monopoly in our state’s two largest metro areas. RealPage and its co-defendants must be held accountable for their role in the astronomical rent increases forced on Arizonans.”  📹 : @Meecha🦩  #arizonapolitics #arizonanews #everythingarizona #azpol #aznews #newstiktok #newstok #arizonarealestate #arizonarentals ",
                    "Cathy Sigmon, a Tempe woman, is one of many volunteering to gather signatures for a ballot initiative that would establish the fundamental right to abortion in Arizona. “Abortion was ruled legal and constitutional when I was in my 20s,” Sigmon said. “So for all of my adult life and for my children, who are now in their late 30s, the right to access abortion and the freedom to make health care decisions was a given.” Arizona for Abortion Access (AAA) is a coalition of groups that advocate for reproductive rights, and they're the driving force behind getting the Arizona Abortion Access Act on the 2024 ballot. The initiative needs roughly 384,000 signatures. Chris Love, a spokeswoman for AAA, said the campaign had gathered 250,000 as of January. Sigmon herself has gathered over 500 signatures. The campaign has until July 4 to submit the total number of signatures needed to get on the ballot. . . . #aznews #arizonanews #arizona #az #2024 #healthcare #reproductiverights #volunteer",

Once a performer’s number and name are called, they elegantly walk on stage under dramatic stage lights as they prepare to start their routine. In the darkness of the auditorium, the audience, the judges sit and wait. “It feels like my skin is on fire and has ants all over it,” says 17-year-old performer Alicia Lucchesi. “And then I get on stage and it’s still there, but the second I start moving, it’s like it disappears. I come off and it feels like I’ve taken the first breath after a million years of not breathing.” As Lucchesi’s music begins, she rises on her toes and performs a solo from “La Esmeralda.” Her striking red costume billows as she turns and leaps through the classical ballet. Lucchesi’s muscle memory kicks in as she’s been practicing for months and waiting for this moment at the four-day Youth America Grand Prix (YAGP) international student ballet scholarship competition. “Freedom of the movement, but also the discipline of what’s right and what’s wrong – it’s a consistency and that’s what I like about it,” Lucchesi said. . . . #ballet #dance #dancelife #dancers #balletdancer #dancing #ballerina #dancersofinstagram #phx #phoenix #az #arizona #scholarships #scholarship #arizonalife #arizonaschools #arizonaliving #azcheck #arizonacheck",

I swear, the pitch had to be down the pipe to be called a strike in favor of Iowa, but when batting it didn’t seem reciprocated. \n\nIt just seemed like there were moments that the game could/should have changed. Having what looks like a obvious walk turn into a out makes a difference. Having a strike called a ball that would have been an out, makes a difference.\n\nObviously, hitting damn near 10 batters and a timely error is a sure fire way to lose a game. I can’t understand throwing a clearly struggling pitcher in deep shit for 2-3 innings. ISU was in a position to blow the game wide open all night. Iowa was doing a pretty good job of beating themselves while hanging around. The true home team didn’t need extra help from the ump.\n\nHonestly, the same crap happened against UNC. There is such a large argument for an automated strike zone. It helps with the purity of the game, screw the tradition crap.",

They had only won 2 games, and they had just gotten rolled on the road by a team with a smash-mouth offense (us).  Sound familiar? You know what happened to them then? They went on a 9-game winning streak, including stunning the Buckeyes at home, and they ended up in Pasadena on New Year's Day. They, too, were installing a new, RPO-based offense, and their wide receivers coach was none other than Josh Gattis. All I'm saying is, the season's not over yet.\n\nTL;DR: This season so far bears striking similarities to Penn State 2016.",

                "description": "I've been a casual MACtion fan for a few years now, primarily with football. However, I've recently cut the cord and am looking for a new conference to focus my sports watching on. I feel like the MAC has one of the best collegiate sports products available right now. Part of that is that from what I've seen, they have a significant cut-off for most if not all of the conference tournaments. For example in basketball as I'm sure most of you are aware, the top eight teams at the end of the regular season go to Cleveland. For baseball starting this year, it will be the top 6 teams (out of 11, Buffalo does not field a baseball team) that make the conference tournament.\n\nIt is an extreme rarity for conferences to have cut-offs for their conference basketball tournaments, and most of the ones that do only cut off one or two teams, whereas the MAC cuts off four, a third of it's membership. This in my opinion adds value to the regular season that a conference would not ordinarily get. It both adds drama to the end of the regular season as teams fight for not only seeding but berths to the tournament and a chance at a MAC title, but also provides further incentive to teams to do well in the regular season.\n\nNot to mention that the MAC has the highest graduation rate of all FBS conferences, I'm definitely impressed by what the MAC has put together, and while it's still here, I'm going to definitely enjoy more of it over the coming years.",

                "description": "by J.D. Moore\n\nTony the Tiger walked up to a child in Section 18 of the Sun Bowl, underestimated his own strength, and [ripped off the handle of child's umbrella while trying to open it](https://twitter.com/RedditCFB/status/1476979459777572872). With both parties shocked, Tony could only hand back the broken umbrella as he wandered off to find his next adventure.\n\nIn a similar manner, the Central Michigan Chippewas showed up to a bowl game that invited them just five days earlier and threw their strength into Washington State, leading the Cougars 21-0 at halftime and ultimately winning 24-21. \n\nCentral Michigan, who was originally set to play Boise State in the Arizona Bowl, arrived to El Paso less than 24 hours before the opening kickoff. CMU head coach Jim McElwain said he had never seen a week like this in his career, which included just one practice and a rapid turnaround for opponent film study.\n\n\"I hope we never have to do it again,\" McElwain said while laughing in his post-game press conference and [reflecting on the victory](https://twitter.com/RedditCFB/status/1477030839892520961). \"I'd love to say [we won on] great coaching, but it's great players. We have a great staff and they need to get some rest. Any time you play, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are. You play to win and our guys went out to win.\"\n\nThe Chippewa victory was the first-ever win by a MAC team over a Pac-10/12 opponent and first bowl win for CMU since 2012. Led by Lew Nichols III's 120 yards of rushing, the CMU offense stayed consistent while Washington State's offense sputtered while missing players like starting tackles Liam Ryan and Abe Lucas, and running backs Max Borghi and Deon McIntosh, who opted out of the game. WSU freshman QB Jayden De Laura left the game in the second quarter due to injury, and Washington State couldn't quite capitalize on a new-found resurgence in the second half, as the Chippewa defense forced a turnover on downs by tackling receiver Joey Hobert just short of the chains.\n\nJake Dickert, head coach for Washington State, gave credit to the Chippewas on preparing for the Sun Bowl quickly and said the Cougars are \"indebted\" to the Sun Bowl and Sun Bowl Association for finding them a new opponent after Miami opted out due to COVID-19 issues.\n\n\"We prepared for the other opponent for four weeks,\" said Jake Dickert, Washington State's head coach. \"I'm not going to use that as an excuse though because [CMU] had the same time frame as we had. It goes both ways and credit to Central Michigan.\"\n\nFive days was all the Chippewas needed to win their highest-profile bowl game in program history and [leave coated in Frosted Flakes](https://twitter.com/RedditCFB/status/1477020628301627399). Now, Central Michigan can only go forward and [look for its next adventure.](https://twitter.com/RedditCFB/status/1477022303233925126).",

                    "In the movie “The Proposal,” Sandra Bullock’s character, Margaret Tate, is depicted as a demanding and often harsh boss.  She uses her authority to manipulate her assistant, Andrew, and treats him unfairly and inappropriately by coercing him to pretend to be her fiancé under the threat of termination. Andrew would most likely have an employment law case against Margaret! Margaret’s manipulative, unreasonable, and deceitful behavior creates a hostile work environment (an environment that is intimidating, offensive, or abusive) for Andrew and others, thereby violating anti-discrimination or anti-harassment laws. Andrew would also probably have a case for unpaid wages, as employees have legal rights to be fairly compensated for their time and work, including provisions for overtime pay. Margaret’s “proposal” to not fire Andrew as long as he is complicit with her plan implies that she’s not paying him for the extra work he’s putting in. In a real-world scenario, if an employee were subjected to behavior similar to what Andrew experienced from his boss, there could potentially be grounds for an employment law case, depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. #TheProposal#WorkProblems #Employmentlawyer #LegalInsights #BadBoss ",

                    "Miranda Priestly in \"The Devil Wears Prada\" epitomizes the stereotype of a bad boss with her demanding, harsh, and cruel management style, which includes extreme demands, lack of empathy, micromanagement, verbal abuse, and favoritism. However, several reasons make it unlikely for her to face an employment case: *At-Will Employment: In many jurisdictions, employment is \"at-will,\" allowing employers or employees to terminate the employment relationship without cause or notice, as long as it doesn't violate discrimination laws. * Lack of Discrimination: While her behavior is harsh, it doesn't necessarily discriminate against any protected group based on race, gender, religion, or other factors that could lead to an employment case. Regardless of whether or not an employee would be able to succeed on an employment claim against Miranda, it’s important to remember that while her character makes for captivating drama in the movie, in reality, a healthy work environment is essential for employee well-being and productivity. #TheDevilWearsPrada #WorkProblems #Employmentlawyer #LegalInsights",

                    "In the movie \"Legally Blonde,\" Professor Callahan, who serves as both Elle's professor and internship boss, suggests that Elle could become his associate for the summer. However, during a conversation, he crosses a boundary by inappropriately placing his hand on her knee. Elle responds swiftly, but she decides not to report the incident and instead chooses to walk away. Elle's decision to leave without reporting is unfortunately not uncommon, and it reflects a classic case of Quid Pro Quo sexual harassment. This term refers to situations where an employee faces negative consequences, such as job loss or denial of promotion, if they refuse to comply with their employer's or supervisor's sexual demands. Statistics from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) indicate that the percentage of women who experience sexual harassment at work can range from 25% to 85%. Even the lower end of this range is deeply concerning. It is important to note that approximately 75% of sexual harassment cases go unreported, contributing to the variability in the reported statistics. If you have experienced sexual harassment in your workplace, even if you are an intern, it is crucial to understand your rights and seek justice.

                    "Thursday marked the beginning of the massive police deployment in New York City subways amid the recent rise in subway crimes. The deployment comes after Gov. Kathy Hochul revealed her five-point plan to bring additional state resources to bear on combatting subway crime in New York City. The new deployment allowed for an additional 1,000 NYPD officers ordered into the subway last month to conduct bag checks and follows the slashing of a conductor and other high profile crimes. The first police officers Eyewitness News observed were catching fare beaters at Columbus Circle, while even more police officers were seen watching the platforms at 72nd Street. \"Yeah, I think so,\" said rider Craig Issac on if the extra police presence will make a difference. \"Because even just seeing someone in authority on the trains will probably prevent, you know, any type of crime from happening.\" Teams of uninformed police officers were seen at stations on the East and West Side handing out summonses, stopping on and off the trains and doing check-ins with conductors. \"It is important to have them around,\" said one conductor. \"Yeah, I feel it's safe enough,\" said rider Veronica Rok. \"But I also feel like I'm taking a little bit of a risk.\" Those travelling in Grand Central saw National Guard soldiers watching the crowds. Marlene Onoyeyan was waiting to take the LIRR to Queens because she's terrified of the subway. \"It would take a lot at this point,\" said Onoyeyan to Eyewitness News. \"I don't trust it anymore.\" Thursday night saw teams of transit cops fanning out the busy Barclays Center in Brooklyn, waiting for scofflaw straphangers. \"Their main mission is engaging with acts of lawlessness,\" said NYPD Transit Bureau Deputy Chief Timothy Skretch. \"That's jumping the turnstile, use of drugs in the system, urinating in the system, and all type of complaints that we get from our riders.\" #nyc #subway #news ",

                    "A 48-year-old man has been arrested after police say body parts were found inside a Bronx apartment on Tuesday night. Sheldon Johnson is charged with murder, manslaughter and criminal possession of a weapon. He's accused of killing and dismembering a man. Police say Johnson is an ex-convict who works as a criminal justice reform advocate. The gruesome discovery was made Tuesday, when authorities were called to 979 Summit Avenue in the Highbridge section at around 8:25 p.m. for a wellness check of an occupant in Apartment 6G. Orlando Medina, the building superintendent, says a tenant called him around 1 a.m. \"Someone was pleading for their life. She said she heard two gunshots, someone said 'please don't kill me I got family,' something like that and two more gunshots pretty quickly,\" Medina said. A torso and arms were found inside the apartment. Detectives obtained a search warrant Wednesday night for Johnson's Harlem apartment on Fifth Avenue where they found the victim's legs and head in a freezer. The victim, later identified as 44-year-old Collin Small, had been shot once in the head. The Medical Examiners Office told detectives bullet fragments were found in the victim's head, leading to the murder charge. Concrete was found in the suspect's car and investigators also recovered a Tyvek suit, officials say. Johnson has previously served about 25 years behind bars for attempted murder and other charges. He appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast last month where he talked about how he turned his life around. \"It was at that moment that I really said - I have to change my life - I have to change my life - I just can't do this,\" Johnson said on the podcast. \"I had a wife, I had kids, I had family still, my son was growing up - he was hearing stories of my so-called notoriety - I just didn't want to be that dad.\" Johnson went on to talk about being a former gang member and when he was released from prison, he says he chose to walk away from that life. At Johnson's arraignment on Thursday night, his supporters filled the courtroom. One supporter wore a jacket reading \"specializing in wrongful conviction arrests.\" The executive director of his employer, the Queens Defenders, was also at court. They all declined comment. The judge remanded Johnson, and he is due back in court on Monday. #news #nyc ",
                    "At least 18 New York City employees were arrested on Thursday for allegedly stealing identities to get financial benefits during the COVID pandemic. The suspects are accused of impersonating homeless people at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and using their names to illegally get their pandemic benefits. Some of those homeless people died during the pandemic. The suspects include five Department of Homeless services workers, as well as employees of the NYPD, MTA, USPS and NYCHA. Prosecutors believe they are responsible for obtaining nearly $1.2 million in fraudulent benefits between April 2020 and October 2021. Officials say approximately 170 people had their identities stolen. It is alleged that the five DHS employees got shelter resident information from paper and digital files and shared them with the group. \"Stealing the identities of New Yorkers, many of them homeless, and defrauding a critical social safety program during one of the most challenging times in our city's history is downright shameful and we allege criminal,\" said District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Prosecutors say they were looking into a DHS employee who may have been manufacturing ghost guns when investigators discovered the other alleged fraud. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty on Thursday and the judge set bail for almost every suspect.#nyc #fraud #news ",
                    "A tire fell off a United Airlines flight departing from San Francisco International Airport to Osaka, Japan Thursday morning, officials confirmed. \"At approximately 11:35 a.m., United Flight 35 departing to Osaka lost a portion of landing gear tire during takeoff,\" a United representative said. The tire debris landed in one of the airport's employee parking lots. There were no injuries reported, but SKY7 was over the scene, where police placed caution tape around cars that appeared to be hit by the tire. In a statement, United Airlines said the flight was diverted to LAX where it landed safely. The company says crews are now working to arrange a new aircraft to take passengers to Osaka on Thursday evening. United said the flight had 235 customers, 10 flight attendants and four pilots -- for a total 249 people on board. \"The 777-200 has six tires on each of its two main landing gear struts. The aircraft is designed to land safely with missing or damaged tires,\" the airline said. Officials say the runway was briefly closed to clear debris, but was soon reopened, with no further impact to airport operations anticipated. An eyewitness is describing what he saw after the tire fell and damaged several cars. \"At the speed and velocity that it was coming down, it would have crushed somebody like a grape,\" said Gary Glass. He described to us what it looked like watching that tire. The plane it fell from had just taken off at SFO, seen on video that was recorded by Cali Planes on YouTube. Glass was driving near the rental car facility and just 50 feet away as he watched the tire hit nearby vehicles. \"I look up and it's a tire spinning at a rapid speed. It bounced in the staff parking lot and it bounced onto a car, a small compact car and I thought that it was going to crush that car and stay there but it actually bounced again really high, and tires still spinning and then landed on a red Tesla and completely totaled and crushed the red Tesla,\" said Glass. Multiple cars were damaged but no one hurt. \"I've never seen anything like that, I was in shock for about 15 or 20 minutes,\" he added. The plane, that was initially headed to Japan, rerouted to LAX where it landed safely. Those in the Bay are just a bit taken back after what happened. \"I knew it was a plane tire right away because they are huge, right? They are like the size of the entire wheel well of a car. When it hit that Tesla, I just remember the glass, the metal crunch and the shatter of the glass - was just really a lot,\" said Glass. Aviation experts said planes losing tires is a rare occurrence and not indicative of a larger safety issue. \"In aviation, we never want to have single points of failure if they can be avoided, and this is a case in point,\" said Alan Price, a former chief pilot for Delta Air Lines. \"The remaining tires are fully capable of handling the load,\" he added. Price said a loose tire it's normally a maintenance issue and not a problem created by the manufacturer. John Cox, a retired pilot and professor of aviation safety at the University of Southern California, agreed. \"I don't see any impact for Boeing as it was a United maintenance team that changed the tire,\" he said. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) released a statement saying it will investigate this incident. Read United's full statement below: United flight 35 lost one tire after takeoff from San Francisco and landed at LAX. Our team quickly arranged for a new aircraft to take customers to Osaka this evening. We're grateful to our pilots and flight attendants for their professionalism in managing this situation. We're also grateful to our teams on the ground who were waiting with a tug to move the aircraft soon after it landed and to our teams in the airport who assisted customers upon their arrival. We will work with customers as well as with the owners of the damaged vehicles in SFO to ensure their needs are addressed. #plane #airtravel #news",

It's part of Worcester Public Library's 'March Meowness.' A photo, or even a drawing, of any cat, erases fines.

                    "There is a big controversy over a play in a state semi-final high school basketball game in New Jersey. The ending of the game between Manasquan and Camden is being talked about around the country. Manasquan made what they believed to be a game-winning bucket to beat Camden. But the referees stopped their celebration and named Camden the winner, saying the ball left the player's hands too late. There are no reviews in New Jersey high school basketball. Now Camden moves on to the state championship as Manasquan's season comes to an end. The NJSIAA released a statement saying they understand the frustration and never want a game to end with controversy. They apologized for the error and explained what happened: \"Here, all of the events happened within the final second of the game. One of the three officials counted the basket as beating the buzzer. The three officials then met at half court to confer. A second official saw the ball in the shooter's hands when the buzzer sounded. The officials then waived off the basket. Later, after being shown video clips, the second official agreed the basket should have counted. That said, the rules are clear -- once game officials leave the 'visual confines of the playing court,' the game is concluded, and the score is official. So, while the officiating crews' reports indicate that a post-game review of footage of the play in question convinced them that the basket should have counted, the results could not then and cannot now be changed. Also, NJSIAA Program Regulations, Section 14 - which governs the use of video - states, 'No video or audio recording may be used to review or challenge the decision of a sports official.' In addition, NJSIAA Bylaws, Article VII, Section 1 prohibit protests 'based upon an official's judgment or misinterpretation (misapplication) of the playing rules.' The ruling on the court is, exclusively and by rule, what determines the game winner. Unlike in college or the pros, there is no instant replay review in high school basketball in New Jersey. These are the rules of the game that all schools agree to follow, and which have been upheld on appeal. We apologize to the Manasquan team for the error.\" The Manasquan School District said in a statement it is pursuing all avenues of appeal: \"The District is aware of the controversial call that occurred in the final second of last night's Group 2 Semifinal Boys Basketball game. The District stands by our student-athletes, coaches, and community in their concern over this incident. We are currently engaged in pursuing all possible avenues of appeal with the NJSIAA and otherwise in the pursuit of ensuring fair play and integrity in all athletic competitions.\" #buzzerbeater #basketball #news",
                    "A man accused of squatting inside a couple's recently purchased multi-million dollar home in Douglaston, Queens, says there is \"more to the story.\" 7 On Your Side Investigates caught up with Brett Flores outside Queens Civil County with his attorney Dennis O'Sullivan. Flores appeared for a scheduled hearing in the case. \"I can't give you the whole story,\" said O'Sullivan who was standing next to Flores. Flores directed all questions about the case to his attorney. As we first reported last week, Joseph and Susana Landa purchased a $2 million home in Douglaston, Queens back in October. They say Flores has refused to leave the property. Court documents show Flores used to work for the former homeowner Bernard Fernandez as his caretaker. He was paid $3,000 a week and his unemployment ended in January of 2023 when Fernandez died. Flores has remained in the home. The house went on the market and the Landas purchased the property. \"He is just technically an ex-employee, he worked for the guy that passed away, that's it,\" Susana Landa said. The Landas say they had no idea the problem they were inheriting. \"Our system is broken, I would never imagine we have no rights,\" Susana Landa said. They're suing Flores in Landlord Tenant Court to try and get Flores evicted. They claim not only has Flores been living in the home, they say he has listed the home online in the past to rent out rooms to other people. Meanwhile, Flores is suing them for alleged harassment. Flores claims he has audio recordings that will help tell his side of the story. They're recordings he hasn't released to Eyewitness News or to the court, and he and his attorney won't elaborate more on what's on the recordings. A judge in Queens Civil Court told Flores and his attorney he has one week to provide the recordings to the Landa family and their attorney. O'Sullivan told the judge he had been retained by Flores hours before the hearing and needed more time to prepare. When a judge asked why it has taken so long to hire an attorney and produce the recordings, O'Sullivan said \"He has a newborn child with respiratory issues.\" \"A revelation will turn this narrative on its head,\" O'Sullivan told Eyewitness News. \"The homeowners, the Landas, are not victims in this case.\" O'Sullivan gave no proof as to why. Meanwhile, we've learned Brett Flores, who also goes by Brett Fisher, was arrested at the home in question on December 13 in an unrelated case. He's accused of pushing, picking up and throwing down his wife. He's facing both assault and harassment charges in that case. The next hearing for the eviction isn't until April. Meanwhile, Flores has filed for bankruptcy which has delayed the process. #queens #nyc #news",
                    "Street parking was already scarce in Hoboken, New Jersey, when the death of an elderly pedestrian spurred city leaders to remove even more spaces in a bid to end traffic fatalities. For seven years now, the city of nearly 60,000 people has reported resounding success: Not a single automobile occupant, bicyclist or pedestrian has died in a traffic crash since January 2017, elevating Hoboken as a national model for roadway safety. Mayor Ravi Bhalla was a City Council member in 2015 when a van struck 89-year-old Agnes Accera as she crossed Washington Street in the bustling downtown business district. Bhalla didn't know Accera but attended her wake and said her death inspired him to push for better safety. \"I felt it wasn't acceptable,\" Bhalla said. \"Our seniors, who we owe the greatest duty of safety to, should be able to pass that street as safely as possible. For her to actually be killed was a trigger that we needed to take action.\" Bhalla became mayor in 2018 and the city fully committed to Vision Zero: a set of guidelines adopted by numerous cities, states and nations seeking to eliminate traffic deaths. Proponents believe no accident is truly unavoidable and even want to do away with the word \"accident\" altogether when describing roadway fatalities. Sweden originated the concept more than a quarter-century ago, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg touted Hoboken in 2022 when announcing his department would follow Vision Zero guidelines. Major U.S. cities including New York, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Baltimore and Portland, Oregon, have integrated aspects of the program into their safety plans, including at least some form of daylighting, the term for the removal of parking spaces near intersections to improve visibility. Hoboken's success has chipped away at the notion that reaching zero traffic deaths is more aspirational than achievable. \"That goal is obviously bold,\" said Leah Shahum, founder and director of the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety. \"It's also meant to help us kind of shake off the complacency that we've had for too long that traffic deaths are inevitable, that what we're experiencing today is just an unfortunate and unavailable byproduct of modern society. That's not the case.\" While Hoboken's plan has numerous components, including lower speed limits and staggered traffic lights, daylighting is often credited as one of the biggest reasons its fatalities have dropped to zero. Ryan Sharp, the city's transportation director, said when roads need to be repaved, Hoboken takes the additional step of cordoning off the street corners to widen curbs and shorten crosswalks. It's already illegal to park at an intersection in Hoboken, but drivers often do anyway if there aren't physical barriers. Some of the new concrete structures are equipped with bike racks, benches and even rain garden planters that help absorb stormwater runoff. If there isn't enough money for an infrastructure solution right away, the city puts up temporary bollards. \"There really isn't a silver bullet or any magic, innovative thing where we've cracked a code,\" Sharp said. \"Our approach has been more about focusing on the fundamentals. We've created a program where we're layering these things in year after year.\" But removing parking from a place where it's in short supply has critics. Joe Picolli, who opened Hoboken Barber Shop on Washington Street in 2018, said the curb extensions - or bumpouts - have made it difficult for downtown merchants to win back business lost during the pandemic. \"Before the bumpouts, there were a lot more buses, a lot more cars, a lot more parking,\" said Picolli, who lives in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, and sometimes has to trail street sweepers to find parking. \"It's good as far as people walking on the street, but it's bad because you're not getting the flow from other towns.\" #hoboken #news #cars ",

                    "The Montefiore Albert Einstein School of Medicine on Monday announced it has received a $1 billion donation which will allow free tuition for all medical school students. The donation marks the largest made to any medical school in the United States. It was made by Dr. Ruth Gottesman, the chair of the Einstein Board of Trustees. \"This donation radically revolutionizes our ability to continue attracting students who are committed to our mission, not just those who can afford it,\" said Marilyn and Stanley Katz Dean at Albert Einstein College of Medicine Dr. Yaron Tomer said in a press release. \"Additionally, it will free up and lift our students, enabling them to pursue projects and ideas that might otherwise be prohibitive.\" The historic announcement also allows current fourth-year students to be reimbursed their spring 2024 semester tuition, and effective beginning in August of this year, all students moving forward will receive free tuition at the college. \"I am profoundly grateful to Dr. Gottesman for this historic and transformational gift,\" said President and CEO of Montefiore Einstein Philip O. Ozuah, \"I believe we can change healthcare history when we recognize that access is the path to excellence. With this gift, Dr. Gottesman will fund excellence in perpetuity and secure our foundational mission of advancing human health.\" As of the 2023-24 school year, Einstein is home to 737 M.D. students, 209 Ph.D. students, 124 students in the combined M.D./Ph.D. program, and approximately 239 postdoctoral research fellows. Officials say the gift is intended to attract a talented and diverse pool of students who may not otherwise have the means to pursue a medical education. #nyc #college #news #wow ",
                    "There is a growing memorial for Flaco. There are notes, flowers, art, and more dedicated to the owl that sadly died Friday. His life was so meaningful to New Yorkers. Flaco, a 14-year-old Eurasian Eagle-owl escaped from the Central Park Zoo after someone cut a hole through his cage back in February of last year. He quickly become a sensation, for birders and non-birders alike. To many he represented freedom. Sadly, though, this past Friday he was found on the ground of an apartment courtyard on the Upper West Side by the building's superintendent. He and a resident tried to save Flaco, but he didn't make it. An initial exam conducted by the Wild Bird Fund indicates that he died from colliding into a window, but the Bronx Zoo is performing more tests to determine if any other factors like rodenticide led to this happening. According to NYC Audubon's research, between 90,000 and 230,000 birds are killed in the City each year in collisions with building glass. The building's super told Eyewitness News how sad he felt about making this tragic discovery. \"Hurts, that's very bad,\" said Pjetar Nikac, Superintendent. \"Beautiful bird.\" \"The amount of people coming with flowers...it says a lot about New Yorkers,\" said Sunday Humphrey, memorial visitor. A petition is now being circulated to erect a statue in the park in Flaco's honor, it reached its goal of 500 signatures and is now aiming for 1,000. Local leaders are also renewing their push for a bill that would require new or renovated buildings to have bird-friendly designs. It would be renamed: Flaco's Act. #nyc #news #owl #flaco #nature ",
                    "A war-wounded little boy from Gaza, now in a hospital on Staten Island, is not only recovering from physical injuries, but emotional scars that has wounded his loving heart. Omar Abukwaik smiles right through the shrapnel wounds that still scar his bright young face. His aunt is all that's left of his family now. Abukwaik grew up in Gaza, and at just 4 years old, the little boy has learned all there is to know about loss, in one horrifying instant. \"Omar's house was destroyed from a missile and his whole family was buried under the rubble,\" said Elisa Montati of the Global Medical Relief Fund. Abukwaik lost most of an arm and suffered severe burns when an Israeli missile struck and destroyed his family home in Gaza. He lost his parents, grandparents and a sister that day. Somehow, Abukwaik survived. \"Omar had a blast injury toward the left side of his face during an explosion in Gaza and he was known to have a perforated hole in his eardrum,\" said Dr. Christopher Lisi of Richmond University Medical Center. A group called the Global Medical Relief Fund managed to get Abukwaik and his aunt first to Egypt, then to the U.S. for treatment. Now at the Richmond University Medical Center, Abukwaik's hearing is improving. He was fitted for a prosthetic arm, but there is still so much left to heal. \"He does still struggle with some trauma, associated triggers, sleep issues, startled responses, outbursts at times, panic attacks that have actually been improved,\" Dr. Nida Khan said. \"He really doesn't talk about his family. The avoidance part is still there.\" Abukwaik has plenty to avoid. Still, doctors and the Global Medical Relief Fund are giving him a chance to have a future. \"Having the opportunity to take care of this young little boy is something that is very special for all of us,\" said Daniel Messina of Richmond University Medical Center. Abukwaik will go back to Gaza and the war there, when his physical and emotional therapy are finished. #nyc #news ",

In New York City, getting a cannabis license is hard enough as it is. \"This was not on our radar, and we tried, we did not want to cover this up at all,\" said Christina de Giovanni, CEO of Emerald Dispensary. \"We love this mural from the minute we moved into this building, and we had artwork done on the front of the building and along the side, we all agreed we're not touching this big mural. We love this. This stays.\" Initially, it didn't quite work out that way. The iconic childhood mural of Biggie, that went up three years ago in Bushwick where the Emerald Dispensary is now open for business, was covered up with black removable graffiti before it opened its doors last week. \"We were following the regulations,\" Giovanni said. \"We had a state inspection a couple weeks ago, and so prior to that, we had been speaking to a compliance officer and we were aware of the regulations in regards to exterior artwork. And so, we covered it up because we thought that we were in compliance. We thought that that is what needed to happen to be in compliance.\" It was in compliance with the Office of Cannabis Management, but Brooklyn wasn't having it. \"No, there's a lot of passionate people here,\" Giovanni said. \"A lot of people would walk by and would just question, what are you doing? Why is this happening? You know, this has been here for a few years, why are you covering it up? And we would explain the situation to them. And, you know, they would understand, but they would still be disappointed.\" There were passersby who asked about the mural, but there was also so much outrage the dispensary received dozens of death threats. One Instagram post said, \"300 writers coming for that wall y'all painted over! Can't diss my bro @huetek and get away with it.\" \"This is a dream come true. This shows you everybody from the streets. Everybody in the streets. Your dreams can come true,\" said Ramon Roman, co-owner of Emerald Dispensary. \"Actually, I was doing this illegally for all my life, you know, not to be able to do it legally. It's amazing. It's a dream come true.\" The dream is still alive for the dispensary owners, saying they got word from OCM last week that the mural could stay, after so much public outcry. \"I mean, I'm so happy,\" Roman said. \"I'm just happy that we were able to get this, you know, over with.\" #nyc #brooklyn #news ",
                    "A financial advice columnist is sharing her terrifying experience of falling victim to an elaborate phone hustle, which ultimately led her to putting $50,000 in a shoebox and handing it over to the scammers. Prospect Heights resident Charlotte Cowles is sharing a warning after phone scam artists convinced her to give them tens of thousands of dollars. \"I thought that I would never fall for something like this,\" she said. Cowles, a columnist for New York Magazine's 'The Cut,' wrote a now viral article, \"The Day I Put $50,000 in a Shoe Box and Handed it to a Stranger.\" \"It unfolded very gradually, incrementally over five hours on the phone,\" she said. Back in October, scammers called her, first pretending to be with Amazon saying her account was compromised. She then got transferred to someone claiming to be with the Federal Trade Commission telling her she was the victim of identity fraud. That led to a fake CIA agent saying a warrant was out for her arrest and she had to withdraw $50,000 from her bank to protect her assets. \"Don't tell anyone... everyone is a suspect,\" the phony agent said to Cowles. \"I think that what these people do is they're very good at targeting people figuring out their one specific vulnerability,\" Cowles said. \"They had very intimate details about me, about my family members. They knew where I lived, they knew the last four digits of my social security number, they knew about my son. And it was terrifying.\" According to the FTC however, scammers posing as government agents is common, and Americans lost a total of $2.7 billion just last year to these kinds of hustles. The NYPD are even sharing videos telling New Yorkers that officials will not call to request money. They are urging them to just hang up. Cowles says she did file a police report. The scam is still under investigation. While she can't get the money back, her hope is to prevent others from being swindled like her. #news #money #scam ",
                    "New surveillance footage shows the three suspects whohttps://abc7ny.com/gucci-nyc-robbery-suspects/14445177/ in the Meatpacking District on Monday. The robbers entered the store on West 14th Street, in one of the city's busiest and trendiest neighborhoods, around noon. The suspects, two men, and a woman had their identities disguised as they burst into the store, displayed a gun, and told everyone in the store to get down. The video shows one robber jetting toward store merchandise, grabbing everything he could. Another robber followed in a similar pursuit, pulling a Gucci luggage set outside the store. The third robber, the woman, can be seen holding a gun in her hand. The trio took several pieces of luggage and other miscellaneous items worth $51,000. The thieves got away in a black Toyota with New York license plates westbound on 14th Street. Police say they were headed toward New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel. No shots were fired during the robbery and no one was injured, authorities said. Just last week, Governor Kathy Hochul discussed fighting retail theft with a unified law enforcement response. \"To not know whether someone coming in the door is going to do them harm, knock them over and sweep the shelves, sometimes a shooting, sometimes a knifing, it has to stop. We have to protect these workers and send a message,\" Hochul said. Tourists in the area said they couldn't believe the brazen robbery happened in the middle of the day. \"It's very daring and middle of the day for somebody to rob a very high-end store at gunpoint and put all the poor people there at risk, terrible,\" said Rosemary Welburn, a tourist from Australia.

                    "On the first Sunday of Lent, there is controversy surrounding a funeral service Thursday at St. Patrick's Cathedral. This weekend, the cathedral's pastor offered a mass of reparation following the service for Cecilia Gentili, a well-known transgender advocate - a service that church leaders now describe as 'sacrilegious and deceptive.' Thursday's funeral packed the cathedral with friends and members of a community expressing gratitude for her advocacy. Some are questioning why a funeral for a trans activist and self-proclaimed atheist be held at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The New York Archdiocese issued a statement saying, in part, 'The Cathedral only knew that family and friends were requesting a funeral mass for a Catholic, and had no idea our welcome and prayer would be degraded in such a sacrilegious and deceptive way.' Gentili's family responded with a statement saying that all are supposed to be welcome, \"We brought precious life and radical joy to the Cathedral in historic defiance of the Church's hypocrisy and anti-trans hatred. Cecilia Gentili's funeral service, which filled the pews in ways the Cathedral only can during Easter service and NYPD funerals, was a reflection of the love she had for her community and a testament to the impact of her tireless advocacy.\" New York's Catholic League issued a statement of its own, calling the event 'profane' and saying 'those who support defiling St. Patrick's Cathedral are rank anti-Catholic bigots who look, talk, and act like deranged men and women.' And taking issue with the funeral being led by a Catholic priest who referred to Gentili as a woman. Meanwhile, Fr. Eric Andrews, a pastor at nearby St. Paul the Apostle Church, which is Catholic and LGBTQ-friendly, posted on social media hinting that the Cathedral could have done some homework, writing, \"Pro Tip: It is good pastoral practice to reach out to the family of the deceased directly to express condolences and to plan a funeral liturgy--and by all means google the name of the person to learn as much as you can about their life. Beyond that, all I can say to our neighboring parish is: Welcome to LGBTQ Ministry.\" Gentili was an icon in the LGBTQ community, known and truly beloved for her decades of advocacy and activism. Actor Billy Porter was among those in attendance on Thursday to say goodbye. Since the funeral was officiated by Catholic priests, it did not raise too many questions at first. Gentili's family declined to talk on camera because they are grieving.#nyc #news ",
                    "A rule at the Atlantic Terminal Mall in Downtown Brooklyn requires anyone under the age of 18 to be accompanied by an adult. According to Madison International Realty, the mall's management company, a chaperone policy has actually been in place for several years now to \"foster a safe environment for individuals, families, and retailers.\" The rule happens to also align with the policy of the Target, also located in the mall, which has a sign outside the story that reads: \"All guests under the age must be accompanied by an adult Monday through Friday.\" Some say the rule is not entirely surprising. \"There's a lot of fighting with no guidance or any adult guidance or anything like that so a lot has changed since I was coming up,\" said Tara Thomas. \"They just be like destroying the store and stuff,\" said another shopper. Atlantic Terminal isn't the only mall with a policy like this. The Garden State Plaza in New Jersey has a parental guidance rule due to what it says is an increase in disruptive behavior, but it's only enforced on Friday and Saturday after 5 p.m. \"It's not fair,\" said Kayla, who falls under the required age limit of the new policy. \"What if I want to just go and shop, not do nothing wrong and I can't go in because I'm not 18.\" In a statement, Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso told Eyewitness News he was surprised to hear about the policy, saying \"kids need safe, welcoming spaces to just be kids.\" He also added that the focus should be on \"creating more spaces that are inclusive for people of all ages.\"  #brooklyn #shopping",
                    "The homes of two FDNY chiefs were searched Thursday morning as part of an ongoing federal investigation into building inspections. The searches were part of the continuing investigation into whether required fire department inspections of buildings were being expedited with payments. Anthony Saccavino is head of the FDNY's Fire Prevention Bureau. Brian Cordasco works for him at the Fire Prevention Bureau. Investigators are looking into whether a retired firefighter steered building projects to the two chiefs for expedited inspection approvals. Bribes for expedited safety inspections have been rumored internally for some time. When FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh heard the allegations last year, she notified the city Department of Investigation and placed the two on modified duty. Chiefs Cordasco and Saccavino are not being accused of wrongdoing. Their homes were searched in Staten Island and Brooklyn. Investigators also executed a search warrant at the fire department headquarters. The allegations they face are similar to allegations of expedited building occupancy approvals first raised during an FBI probe into Mayor Eric Adams' campaign fundraising. Though the two probes appear to be separate, there could be implications. \"It doesn't look good for the mayor because, again, here's an indication of a corruption investigation that may or may not be founded but occurred during his watch,\" said political consultant Hank Sheinkopf. A spokesperson for Adams said there is \"no indication of any direct connection to anyone at City Hall.\" \"City Hall became aware of this operation when we were notified by FDNY this morning,\" the spokesperson said. \"The FDNY continues to cooperate with DOI, and there is no indication of any direct connection to anyone at City Hall.\" The FDNY released a statement that said in part they are awaiting guidance from the DOI regarding further action: \"The FDNY's first priority is always keeping New Yorkers safe, and we expect every member of the department to act appropriately. As soon as Commissioner Kavanagh was alerted to these allegations last year, she immediately referred them to DOI to investigate them. Commissioner Kavanagh has proactively placed the employees at the center of this investigation on modified duty, and we are awaiting guidance from DOI regarding further action.\" #nyc #fdny #news ",

                    "Mayor Eric Adams announced Wednesday that New York City is suing four of the nation's largest social media companies and accusing them of fueling a national and local youth mental health crisis. The lawsuit was filed to hold TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, and YouTube Accountable for their damaging influence on the mental health of children, Adams said. The lawsuit, filed in California Superior Court, alleged the companies intentionally designed their platforms to purposefully manipulate and addict children and teens to social media applications.  The lawsuit pointed to the use of algorithms to generate feeds that keep users on the platforms longer and encourage compulsive use. \"Over the past decade, we have seen just how addictive and overwhelming the online world can be, exposing our children to a non-stop stream of harmful content and fueling our national youth mental health crisis,\" Adams said. \"Our city is built on innovation and technology, but many social media platforms end up endangering our children's mental health, promoting addiction, and encouraging unsafe behavior.\" The lawsuit accused the social media companies of manipulating users by making them feel compelled to respond to one positive action with another positive action. \"These platforms take advantage of reciprocity by, for example, automatically telling the sender when their message was seen or sending notifications when a message was delivered, encouraging teens to return to the platform again and again and perpetuating online engagement and immediate responses,\" the lawsuit said. The city is joining hundreds of school districts across the nation in filing litigation to force the tech companies to change their behavior and recover the costs of addressing the public health threat. New York City officials said it has spent significant resources addressing mental health issues among students and is suing to recoup some money. \"NYC Plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur costs related to addressing the youth mental health crisis that Defendants created, caused, contributed to and/or maintained. NYC Plaintiffs request relief relating to the damage or injury they have suffered, including actual and compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial,\" the lawsuit said. Last month, Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan's public health advisory [url HREF=\"https://abc7ny.com/eric-adams-state-of-the-city-nyc-new-york/14355058/\" TARGET=\"_blank\" REL=\"\"]declared social media a public health threat[/url]. The advisory provides recommendations to parents and caregivers, health care providers, educators, and policymakers on actions that can be taken to protect children, including the recommendation to delay social media use until the age of 14. \"No one is talking about a ban, no one is talking about taking, snatching away devices or snatching away platforms,\" Vasan said. \"We're talking about a fundamental set of rules and regulations. And sometimes litigation is the way we have to go about getting it.\" Meta released a statement in response, saying they have been working to keep young people safe for a decade and will continue to work on it. \"We want teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online, and we have over 30 tools and features to support them and their parents,\" a Meta spokesperson said. \"We've spent a decade working on these issues and hiring people who have dedicated their careers to keeping young people safe and supported online.” #nyc #news #socialmedia ",
                    "A North Carolina aquarium and shark lab are expecting a stingray to deliver a miracle any day now. What's the miracle? Charlotte the stingray, who is 12-14 years old, hasn't been around any male stingrays in her tank. At first Brenda Ramer, the founder of Team Ecco, didn't believe it. \"People have written and said well they can hold male sperm for years and I'm like she's never been around a male, until we put those two little boys (sharks) in here,\" she said in an interview with ABC affiliate WLOS. That's when she noticed the bite marks on Charlotte's body, a habit of mating sharks. That means one option for how Charlotte got pregnant is that she mated with Moe or Larry. The other explanation, and the more likely scenario, Charlotte is going through a very rare process called parthenogenesis. That is when the eggs develop on their own without fertilization and create a clone of their mother. \"With our Bamboo Shark up in the other corner, we've had experience with Parthenogenesis with her 14 different times. We had one baby that lived 30 days outside of the egg,\" Ramer said. She said her group has seen and studied several examples of parthenogenesis in sharks. However, it is a much more rare process in stingrays. The last full study, she says, took place a quarter of a century ago. The aquarium where Charlotte lives in Hendersonville has been closed for renovations, but has since reopened. \"We're kind of expecting a deluge, which is great and that's fine. We want people to come and see her and talk to us about her,\" she said. Ramer said when Charlotte does give birth, she could have as many as four pups. If the pups are born alive, Ramer hopes to keep the family together, but will have to get a tank almost double the size of Charlotte's current home. The birth will also provide a chance for Ramer's team to perform DNA testing on the pups to determine if they're a mixed breed or clones of their mother. \"It's a once in a bluest of blue moons experience. And it's like, 'wow.'\"  #nature #bizarre #stingray #shark",
                    "Rents in Manhattan remained largely flat in January, but demand remains high. New data shows the median cost of an apartment in Manhattan was $4,150. That's up only $100 from December but it does mark the first time in three months that rents have ticked higher. New leases in Manhattan jumped 14 percent compared to last January. The high demand is somewhat unusual for this time of the year and helped push up rents at a time when they're expected to level off. In the outer boroughs, demand has surged compared to last year. New leases doubled in Brooklyn compared to a year ago while new leases in northwest Queens jumped 31 percent. Meanwhile, the sky-high fees to rent an apartment appear to be driving up prices overall. A new study from Street Easy says the average renter now pays almost $10,500 in upfront costs. Only one in five renters can pay those costs out of pocket, so they're more likely to stay put than move when their lease is up. Landlords know that so they have more power to raise rents. #nyc #rent #news",

                "description": "My son started second grade last week. I get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). \n\nHe's got a twin sister. I told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. My son picked one up and said \"I want to wear this.\" I'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. I'm pretty politically neutral so while I wouldn't say I was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that I could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. \n\nI figured ok, I wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so I shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. \n\nI drop him off and get to work. Three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. He was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. \n\nMy wife is irate asking how I couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and I was setting our son up to fail. So is just about everyone else I've run this by. My wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as \"the one who wore a dress\" and I was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because I was in a rush and our son suffered for it. \n\nAt the time, I truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that I put my son in harm's way so now I'm not sure whether I made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it.

                "description": "A few things have been bothering me about Dany's early storyline. Ilyrio's stated goal was to help Viserys and Dany reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen. To help them in this goal, he marries Dany to the local warlord Drogo of the Dothraki and gains the Targaryens an army. Furthermore we know Varys and Ilyrio are working together, and that Varys tells Jorah of a plot to kill Dany. Jorah foils this plot, and the attempted assasination convinces Drogo to began plans for an invasion of Westeros.\n\nI don't believe this is as straightforward as it appears. I believe that both Varys and Ilyrio are Blackfyres seeking to install a Blackfyre Aegon to the Iron throne (that theory can be found here http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/156odh/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_the_blackfyre/). \n\nFirst of all, we can analyze the \"gifts\" that Ilyrio and Varys have given the Targaryen outcasts. Ilyrio had supported them for years, feeding and clothing them and providing shelter. Furthermore, Varys' foiled various assassination plots against them. They wanted them alive. Second, Ilyrio was the one to give Dany her dragon eggs. It is important to note that it was commonly believed that they would never ever hatch. Ilyrio had no way of knowing this would be as humungous a gift it turned out to be. Finally we come to their biggest \"gift\", the betrothal to Drogo and his Dothraki army.\n\nBy organizing the Dany and Drogo marriage, Ilyrio gave the Targaryen's an army capable of conquering Westeros. They also state that there are many Targaryen loyalists waiting to pledge their allegiance to the dragon. This all seems good on its face, but falls apart with what we know about the Dothraki. First of all, *they have no chance of ever actually winning*. They cannot siege. They are only useful in the open field and everyone knows this. To repel a Dothraki invasion, the lords would just need to stay in their castles, leaving the Dothraki horde to pillage the countryside. Yet raping and pillaging would turn any potential allies against the Targaryens and their foreign army. All of Westoeros would be against them if they invaded with a raping and pillaging foreign army, and yet *Ilyrio provided the rapiest and pillagiest army in existence. One that had no chance of ever actually winning*. They were set up for complete failure. \n\nThis brings us to why? Why would Varys and Ilyrio be organizing a massive failed invasion? Because this would be the easiest way to plant Aegon on the throne. You know that Varys could kill Robert at any time, and that Robert's death incited mass chaos across Westeros. You also know that Varys' was working as hard as he could to put off Robert's demise as he tells Ned in AGOT. The fractured realm after Robert's death would hardly be able to put up a united front against an invading horde. You would need someone capable of uniting their banners. That someone is Aegon, son of the noble and beloved Rhaegar, rightful king of Westeros. Furthermore he would be supported by the honorable Golden Company and would have Jon Connnington at his side. He would be able to unite the feuding populace under his banner to combat Dany/Viserys, progeny of Aerys and the Mad King come again. As to why Varys and Ilyrio would go to such lengths, this is answered by the Blackfyre theory. Unfortunately this all fell apart once Dany gained her dragons, however I still think it is interesting to think about. Thanks for reading, sorry for the massive walls of text.",

                "description": "I have a kind of funny story with nowhere else to post it, so I apologize in advance for clogging up the sub with this shit post. But here we go...\n\nI recently moved away from home for college and was hanging out over at my roommate's girlfriend's house to get to know them. He had told her that I was really into music, so she offered to let me see her record collection. I graciously accepted. I had never been into record collecting personally, but I love the idea of collections of things so I was eager to see what she had. I'm thumbing through her records, taking note of my favorites, some Stones, Doors, Beatles etc., but a maddeningly small amount of Sabbath or Zeppelin (none) when she comes in. I pull out The Doors' debut and start talking about it. Seeing my enthusiasm, she urges me to start my own collection. I half-heartedly agree and go on about my thumbing. I push the thought to the back of my mind. I decide there that *if I did* start a collection I would probably start with Pink Floyd, which is my favorite band at the moment. And since I'm the kind of person that likes to take things in sets, I figured I would narrow it down to just the big four for now. I couldn't get them all, so I had to pick just a few.\n\nAnyways, fast forward several weeks and I'm in the electronics section of Walmart. I'm looking for a USB cable or something when I happen to walk by the shelf that holds all of their records. I hesitate for a second before thinking *nah, not tonight.* I get about two steps away before I say to myself *well, I'll just see what they have. I'm not buying anything though*. So I turn around and step up to the shelf. There's about five rows of them, so I start at the one all the way to the left. I start flipping through, there's some David Bowie, some Stones, stuff like that. After I've flipped through three or four records, I notice one about three rows down start to fall out. I instinctively stuck my basket out to catch it, and it fell right in. I bring the basket in closer to me, looking to see what I had caught, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. That drab brown cover, a bland sky and a lonely factory, and right there on the cover of the plastic wrap stood PINK FLOYD ANIMALS. Sucker dropped like a stone right into my fucking basket. I'm not religious, but that's the closest thing to a sign from God I've ever experienced. I sighed, cracked a smile, and headed to the checkout with it. That was a few months ago, and I just went back tonight to try and complete the quattro. I picked up Dark Side and The Wall, and just ordered Wish You Were Here online. There's about 90 bucks I didn't need to spend, but fuck it. I'll be starting Zeppelin and Sabbath soon.\n\nJust thought that was a cool Floyd related story. Feel free to share your useless experiences here as well since the post is already taking up space.",

                "description": "A few things have been bothering me about Dany's early storyline. Ilyrio's stated goal was to help Viserys and Dany reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen. To help them in this goal, he marries Dany to the local warlord Drogo of the Dothraki and gains the Targaryens an army. Furthermore we know Varys and Ilyrio are working together, and that Varys tells Jorah of a plot to kill Dany. Jorah foils this plot, and the attempted assasination convinces Drogo to began plans for an invasion of Westeros.\n\nI don't believe this is as straightforward as it appears. I believe that both Varys and Ilyrio are Blackfyres seeking to install a Blackfyre Aegon to the Iron throne (that theory can be found here http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/156odh/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_the_blackfyre/). \n\nFirst of all, we can analyze the \"gifts\" that Ilyrio and Varys have given the Targaryen outcasts. Ilyrio had supported them for years, feeding and clothing them and providing shelter. Furthermore, Varys' foiled various assassination plots against them. They wanted them alive. Second, Ilyrio was the one to give Dany her dragon eggs. It is important to note that it was commonly believed that they would never ever hatch. Ilyrio had no way of knowing this would be as humungous a gift it turned out to be. Finally we come to their biggest \"gift\", the betrothal to Drogo and his Dothraki army.\n\nBy organizing the Dany and Drogo marriage, Ilyrio gave the Targaryen's an army capable of conquering Westeros. They also state that there are many Targaryen loyalists waiting to pledge their allegiance to the dragon. This all seems good on its face, but falls apart with what we know about the Dothraki. First of all, *they have no chance of ever actually winning*. They cannot siege. They are only useful in the open field and everyone knows this. To repel a Dothraki invasion, the lords would just need to stay in their castles, leaving the Dothraki horde to pillage the countryside. Yet raping and pillaging would turn any potential allies against the Targaryens and their foreign army. All of Westoeros would be against them if they invaded with a raping and pillaging foreign army, and yet *Ilyrio provided the rapiest and pillagiest army in existence. One that had no chance of ever actually winning*. They were set up for complete failure. \n\nThis brings us to why? Why would Varys and Ilyrio be organizing a massive failed invasion? Because this would be the easiest way to plant Aegon on the throne. You know that Varys could kill Robert at any time, and that Robert's death incited mass chaos across Westeros. You also know that Varys' was working as hard as he could to put off Robert's demise as he tells Ned in AGOT. The fractured realm after Robert's death would hardly be able to put up a united front against an invading horde. You would need someone capable of uniting their banners. That someone is Aegon, son of the noble and beloved Rhaegar, rightful king of Westeros. Furthermore he would be supported by the honorable Golden Company and would have Jon Connnington at his side. He would be able to unite the feuding populace under his banner to combat Dany/Viserys, progeny of Aerys and the Mad King come again. As to why Varys and Ilyrio would go to such lengths, this is answered by the Blackfyre theory. Unfortunately this all fell apart once Dany gained her dragons, however I still think it is interesting to think about. Thanks for reading, sorry for the massive walls of text.",

                "likes": 0.93,
                "description": "**TL;DR** The warder bond doesn't make you a better swordsman. Mastery of the flame and the void however, makes a massive difference.\n\n---\n\nThere is a common misconception that due to the warder bond, warders are naturally better swordsman than people that aren't bonded. While it is true that the bond provides some benefits, the odds that they will help in a duel is minimal.\n\nHere are the quotes which specify what the bond provides\n\n&gt;The Warders got all sorts of benefits according to the stories. They healed more quickly than other men, and could go longer without food or water or sleep. Supposedly they could sense Trollocs, if they were close enough, and other creatures of the Dark One, too, which explained how Lan and Moiraine had tried to warn the village before the attack.\n\n*The Eye of the World, Chapter 9*\n\n&gt;“Aes Sedai learn to shield their dreams. I do it without thinking, when I sleep. Warders are given something much the same in the bonding.”\n\n*The Dragon Reborn, Chapter 6*\n\nThe bond does NOT provide increased strength, speed, reaction times, and only the tiniest fraction of durability*. Without those, the benefits it provides in a duel is minimal.\n\nThen how come so many warders are so skilled? Because Aes Sedai typically choose skilled fighters to become warders.\n\n---\n\nLet's take a look at what commonalities some of the most skilled swordsmen have between them\n\n* Demandred (the void + saidin enhanced senses)\n\n* [Lan](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/6g8mj2/respect_lan_mandragoran_wheel_of_time/) (the void and the bond)\n\n* [Galad](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/6ktd42/respect_galad_damodred_wheel_of_time/) (the void)\n\n* [Gawyn](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/6k8i36/respect_gawyn_trakand_wheel_of_time/) (the bond)\n\n* [Tam](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/6peg57/respect_tam_althor_wheel_of_time/) (the void)\n\n(I'm leaving out Rand because we never see him fight at his peak while still having both hands.)\n\nThey either have the void, the bond or both - so which is the most important?\n\nIf you take a look at how Demandred vs Gawyn went, compared to Demandred vs Galad, it should be obvious.\n\nGawyn fought Demandred under the influence of the bloodknife ring, which explicitly makes him much harder to see, faster, more agile and greatly damps his sense of pain. And yet, he got demolished by Demandred.\n\nGalad fought Demandred with just the void, and while it was still a decisive loss, it was still a better performance than Gawyn. \n\nSo being able to use the void made more of a difference than both the warder bond and the bloodknife rings combined.\n\n---\n\nSo what exactly does the void do that makes it so valuable in combat? Unlike the bond, it provides:\n\n* increased reaction speed (to the point that Lan experiences a slowed sense of time while using it)\n\n* enhanced senses (to the point that Lan and Tam are able to predict the enemies' next attack, even without being able to see it)\n\n* the ability to ignore physical pain and discomfort\n\nAnd finally, it is also an invaluable tool during practice - perfect awareness of what your body is doing means it is much easier to correct any mistakes you have, and therefore you can learn new skills much faster than a normal person. Think of how quickly Rand learned to fight with the sword, and also how fast he picked up the Aiel martial arts.\n\n---\n\n*There is one outlier where Brandon Sanderson states that it grants enhanced awareness (Gareth Bryne vs the bloodknife). This happens exactly once and is never mentioned again, so I believe it's a mistake.",

With PPL I would use overhand to focus on back since I would add in plenty of bicep isolation volume, but obviously the idea with leangains is to minimize volume. \n\nThanks!",

                "description": "There's been a lot of talk recently (especially on ESPN FC) about whether or not the Premier League has gone down in quality based on European performance and what the best league is. Nearly everyone agrees that it's La Liga, Bundesliga, or EPL but which one? The common argument for Spain and Germany is their dominance in European competitions (UCL and Europa). The argument that can be made for England is the quality of teams from top to bottom, making it a league where any team can win in any given match (like City vs. Burnley or Chelsea vs. Sunderland) meaning that teams have less \"cupcake\" games (I only follow EPL closely so I can't comment on closeness of teams in other leagues). I know that money might have a lot to do with it and the amount that's concentrated at the top vs. more spread around as well as youth academy structure vs. buying players. \n\nI also know that best league can be hard to define based on best playing quality vs. most fun to watch vs. most physicaly demanding etc, so justifications/reasoning would be great!\n\nEDIT: So I guess I'm not really asking what the best league is but more what qualities of each league people like to see and how leagues compare to one another in those aspects.",

                "description": "Hello all,\n\nI've beaten SS1 probably 30 times at this point. First played it as a kid but never really understood it/could get into it. Got the EE when it came out and had a blast! Last summer I got addicted to speed-running it and would often beat it daily after I got off work just for the hell of it. Love the game! After I beat the EE to death I got interested in messing around with the original version, and after getting used to the controls (which I honestly think are better and more intuitive than other games of its era...I can't stand OG keyboard only DOOM esque controls at all, ugh...), and I honestly kinda like the DOS version more...\n\nControls: EE is sorta broken lol...with the Laser Sword you are basically a ninja...I honestly think the OG has better controls also because the OG sorta controls less like a modern shooter and more like a light gun game where you can freely move and turn, and the game is designed around this. Ive seen lots of EE players over the years complain about getting blindsided around corners in this game, and I think a lot of that is down to them not playing it like a tactical shooter the games' original controls *want* you to play it as. You're supposed to be using the lean and crouch state functions to make chip shots around corners and surprise foes! It's on the view screen for a reason!  This means you actually have *more* control over your dude at any given time than with the EE's controls. Don't believe me? Try the OG and use the lean function around corners. In the OG you can hit very precise shots due to you having full control over everything in your screen space to shoot rather just a focused point in the middle of the screen. I actually prefer window mode over Fullscreen for this reason as Fullscreen bleeds into your shooting window and it's too easy to accidentally hit something on the use screen when you're trying to shoot something. \n\nGraphics: OG is better here imo because the new lighting model breaks things in EE. The OG has a static lighting model that often flickers the lights on and off or just completely off. In the EE it uses a different model, and often times looks wrong. This is especially noticable in any instance where the lights are supposed to be off and the screen black. In the EE it just sort of fades to a a darker view, where in the OG it would be pitch black. This messes with the atmosphere a lot, especially in level 3...This has gameplay ramifications too as the light and thermal goggles aren't as useful anymore in the new version. \n\nMusic: things loop weird sometimes in the EE. I dunno why, but this is especially noticable in the first level. \n\nOverall, Dosbox is my preferred way to play the game!\n\n\nEdit: and a PSA to all my EE friends: TURN OFF TEXTURE FILTERING!!!! IT MAKES THE GAME LOOK AWFUL!! also do this for all old games :)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Hdv1jxX_d.webp?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium",

                "description": "A few things have been bothering me about Dany's early storyline. Ilyrio's stated goal was to help Viserys and Dany reclaim the Iron Throne for House Targaryen. To help them in this goal, he marries Dany to the local warlord Drogo of the Dothraki and gains the Targaryens an army. Furthermore we know Varys and Ilyrio are working together, and that Varys tells Jorah of a plot to kill Dany. Jorah foils this plot, and the attempted assasination convinces Drogo to began plans for an invasion of Westeros.\n\nI don't believe this is as straightforward as it appears. I believe that both Varys and Ilyrio are Blackfyres seeking to install a Blackfyre Aegon to the Iron throne (that theory can be found here http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/156odh/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_the_blackfyre/). \n\nFirst of all, we can analyze the \"gifts\" that Ilyrio and Varys have given the Targaryen outcasts. Ilyrio had supported them for years, feeding and clothing them and providing shelter. Furthermore, Varys' foiled various assassination plots against them. They wanted them alive. Second, Ilyrio was the one to give Dany her dragon eggs. It is important to note that it was commonly believed that they would never ever hatch. Ilyrio had no way of knowing this would be as humungous a gift it turned out to be. Finally we come to their biggest \"gift\", the betrothal to Drogo and his Dothraki army.\n\nBy organizing the Dany and Drogo marriage, Ilyrio gave the Targaryen's an army capable of conquering Westeros. They also state that there are many Targaryen loyalists waiting to pledge their allegiance to the dragon. This all seems good on its face, but falls apart with what we know about the Dothraki. First of all, *they have no chance of ever actually winning*. They cannot siege. They are only useful in the open field and everyone knows this. To repel a Dothraki invasion, the lords would just need to stay in their castles, leaving the Dothraki horde to pillage the countryside. Yet raping and pillaging would turn any potential allies against the Targaryens and their foreign army. All of Westoeros would be against them if they invaded with a raping and pillaging foreign army, and yet *Ilyrio provided the rapiest and pillagiest army in existence. One that had no chance of ever actually winning*. They were set up for complete failure. \n\nThis brings us to why? Why would Varys and Ilyrio be organizing a massive failed invasion? Because this would be the easiest way to plant Aegon on the throne. You know that Varys could kill Robert at any time, and that Robert's death incited mass chaos across Westeros. You also know that Varys' was working as hard as he could to put off Robert's demise as he tells Ned in AGOT. The fractured realm after Robert's death would hardly be able to put up a united front against an invading horde. You would need someone capable of uniting their banners. That someone is Aegon, son of the noble and beloved Rhaegar, rightful king of Westeros. Furthermore he would be supported by the honorable Golden Company and would have Jon Connnington at his side. He would be able to unite the feuding populace under his banner to combat Dany/Viserys, progeny of Aerys and the Mad King come again. As to why Varys and Ilyrio would go to such lengths, this is answered by the Blackfyre theory. Unfortunately this all fell apart once Dany gained her dragons, however I still think it is interesting to think about. Thanks for reading, sorry for the massive walls of text.",

I have the distinct feeling that my company hired me on as a marketer without really knowing what a marketer does, or what they want out of one. \n\nI’ve been here for almost half a year and have done nearly nothing except write content for a blog that doesn’t exist. Occasionally I do research on tools and competitors that doesn’t get read. My bosses are very busy but also very paranoid. They haven’t given me access to Google Analytics, social media log ins, or any marketing tools. \n\nThey constantly want ideas and I frequently pitch them ideas. But every time they realize these methods have a price, they back down. \n\nI’m a bit frustrated. What marketing can I do with a company who won’t give me log ins and won’t pay for marketing. We might eventually get the blog set up, but even that is like pulling teeth. \n\nSo, more experienced marketers: how would you approach this?",

This is not an amazing story, but I thought everyone would appreciate a happy story for once.\n\nI've held numerous customer service/customer facing positions in my life.  In all of them I was taught to apologize to the customer if I couldn't get them what they want. Even if the reason was beyond my control (out of a product, company policy, the law!).\n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago. I now work for the optical dept of a membership warehouse. A woman asked to order another pair of glasses using an Rx on file. It was expired. I apologized and told her she needed a new one from her eye Dr. She was very understanding and left.  My manager approaches me and says, \"You don't have to apologize you know. There's nothing you could do\". I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nHope you enjoyed!",

What’s even more noteworthy is the sustained momentum, with unions securing victories in three consecutive years (2021-2023) – a trend not witnessed since before 1990.
