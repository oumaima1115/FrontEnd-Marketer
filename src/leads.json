                "text": "The use of Independent Contractors is cost-effective for organizations as the employer is not burdened with withholding payroll taxes, making matching payroll tax contributions, or covering the cost of the employee’s health and retirement benefit plans. The problem is that often times, people do not qualify as independent contractors per the IRS regulations. See below for more insight. \n\n********\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUFl...]\nguHRoo [https://www.guhroo.co/] \nLinkedin [https://www.linkedin.com/company/exec...] \nTwitter [https://twitter.com/ergpayroll]\n\n*******\n\nHiring someone as a Contractor a great opportunity to see if an Independent Contractor will fit in with the organization’s culture as well as whether the individual will be successful in the role for which he or she was contracted. Independent \n\nContractors who find success in their roles and fit in well with a company’s culture hold an advantage should they be hired to become regular employees of an organization as their learning curve is substantially shorter than that of an individual who is hired into the company from the outside. The Independent Contractor has already had an opportunity to become acquainted with the organization’s industry as well with the dynamic of its employees.\n \nAdditionally, opting to allow an Independent Contractor’s contract to expire if he or she is not a good fit for the organization is a simpler task than terminating a regular employee of the company. Some disadvantages, though, are that the employer has substantially less control over an Independent Contractor. \n\nIn addition, an Independent Contractor will not have the loyalty to the organization as would a regular employee. This can be problematic when employers need to strategize for succession planning and cross-training. With an Independent Contractor, employers do not have the same incentive to retain and train these workers as they would a regular employee of the organization. \n \nIf you are a business owner or contractor who provides services to other businesses, then you are generally considered self-employed.  If you are a business owner hiring or contracting with other individuals to provide services, you must determine whether the individuals providing services are employees or Independent Contractors and ensure that the workers are categorized in line with their status. \n \nIt is extremely important to note that the IRS does not allow all workers to be classified as Independent Contractors. The IRS has strict guidance regarding the classification of W-2 Employees verses 1099 Independent Contractors. The basic premise behind the determination is the amount of control that the company has over the worker and how the work is performed.  Another large contributing factor is how important to the work is to the company’s core business. \n \nThe IRS uses a 3-part test to determine whether an individual should be classified as an employee or contractor. This is certainly an area of the law where the IRS is increasing enforcement efforts.  Therefore, it is critically important to ensure that workers are not misclassified as 1099 Independent Contractors when they should be W-2 Employees. Misclassification could result in substantial back taxes, IRS penalties, liability for workplace injuries, retroactive benefits, attorney’s fees, and other monetary damages.\n\nThanks for watching!\n►WATCH NEXT\n✓ Top Mistakes Companies Are Making During COVID-19 - https://youtu.be/tCad_1Cy4IQ\n✓ How to create a marketing strategy + How to onboard remote employees | The Monday Marketing Meeting - https://youtu.be/9Evnj5TJYfo\n\n👉Enjoying the show?

Known as the gig economy, these workers perform tasks for customers that have been assigned to them through mobile apps. The gig workers, if labeled as independent contractors, are left without minimum wage, overtime, benefits, and other job protections that traditional employees receive. That's drawn the attention of some state governments that say gig workers are being misclassified as contractors to avoid costly benefits and payroll taxes. In this video featuring Bloomberg Law’s Erin Mulvaney, we explore why the companies and state governments are at odds over how to properly classify gig workers.

If someone wants to spend a ton of money on a venture with negative expected monetary value, why exactly are we stopping them? We don't do that in any other industry. To stick with the chess example, I am pretty sure a significant portion of the funding for US chess comes from one [really wealthy guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Sinquefield) who really likes chess. I don't think he is making money off it. But he is getting a lot of 'value' because he gets to see more of the thing he enjoys.\n\nThis is partly why determining what something is truly 'worth' is so incredibly difficult. It's not just anything that gives a net profit.\n\nLike no one thinks the Jimbo Fisher buyout is going to make those boosters money right? But there isn't a rule preventing that from happening. The boosters decided it was worth it to them to spend a truly horrific amount of money to make him not the coach of their favorite team.\n\nAnd if they decide that they want to spend a ton of money to make a random kid from Iowa their new backup center, okay. It's their money. They decided it's worth it to them so go for it.\n\n>Schools provide varsity sports as a service to enhance student life\n\nClub sports, sure. We are so unbelievably far from club sports.\n\nSchools sell the tv rights to media companies for billions of dollars. Multiple college coaches make more money than their equivalents in the professional league. Schools spend millions more building special facilities for athletes only, all to entice random high schoolers to come play football for them.\n\nThis is way more than a fun perk for students.\n\nBut at the end of the day, one of the best things about letting the free market decide how much these kids are truly worth is that if, as you say, they aren't actually worth much of anything, then nothing will really change. Eventually, the market would dry up, people will stop spending money to get kids to go to their schools, and you'd be left with a bunch of schools competing with basically club teams. If they are truly generating no value, neither monetarily nor whatever other kind of value getting rid of Jimbo is, then people won't spend that money.\n\nBut everything that CFB is and has been over the last few decades tells me that people absolutely will spend that money. And if they are willing, then that is the amount of value these kids are generating, that is the amount they are worth, and that is what they should be paid.",

NIL is the schools outsourcing paying their employees, and it's wild that they were able to do that. \n\nThis also leads to a ton of ridiculous scenarios where businesses have to get very creative with sponsorships to make sure the kid goes to the right school and they stop getting paid if they transfer out but they aren't allowed say anything explicit like that so it's just a weird series of clauses and loopholes meant to cover up the obvious reality.\n\nPlus boosters drive a lot of it and aren't (nominally) allowed to coordinate with the schools they are recruiting for so you get weird cases where boosters make promises to a kid the coach doesn't actually want and all the messiness that entails.\n\nThe schools are the ones the kids end up playing for, they are the ones who get most of the value either through happy boosters or cold hard cash from media companies, they should be the ones providing a majority of the payment.

That's fine, but if you are a gig worker, being emoployee means all of the things that attracted you to being one will be gone overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main point is that as an employee, you are owned just like a slave. Yes, you are payed, so technically, it doesn't qualify as slavery, but courts have upheld firings over social networking posts which had nothing to do with work or the specific business in question. They have upheld firings of people for doing something outside of work and off of the employer's property. If your boss wants to fire you for being a scorpio, visiting a bar on the weekend, or making a political post about legalizing marijuana, there is no law, in most states, banning them from doing it.\r\n\r\nThey can promise you a forty hour workweek and suddenly require you to work sixty, threatening to fire you if you don't. Of course, not all employers do that, but they can. \r\n\r\nAs an independent contractor, you work for multiple bosses. One might be strict while others aren't so much. If you prefer to dress casually or not work weekends, the only thing that happens is that you lose a few of these bosses. You decide whether or not to follow certain rules to bring in more work. \r\n\r\n yes, your agent, someone like Uber or Lyft who provides you with work might have rules, so it can be similar, but currently, they are pretty hands off, and that's because of your classification as an independent contractor. It changes completely when you become an employee.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt won't be the same job but with a requirement that you get minimum wage and employee benefits like medical insurance. That would come at the price of being a gig worker. You would be a full time employee. You would work the hours your employer says to work. Yes, there are jobs where you do this anyway, but ride share drivers and delivery drivers currently enjoy flexibility which will disappear if they are classified as employees.\r\n\r\nEven our cab companies require that you work a shift. Yes, you lease the vehicle and operate basicly as your own boss, but the timing of the whole thing is up to the company who owns and maintains the vehicle. \r\n\r\nWhere I live, after traveling expenses, drivers are making $19 to $21 per hour on the top end. Yes, this is before taxes, but that means $13 to $15 after taxes, Fica, etc if you factor that in. If you are an employee, you get whatever the boss decides to give you regardless of how many passengers you pick up. In a slower market, this will be great for the few drivers on the road, because they will get payed way more for working less and get employee benefits, but if you carry a lot of passengers, there is no guarantee that you will be payed more for that. If there is a lot of competition for rides, that means there are too many drivers on the road, so Uber or Lyft won't hire as many or will lay people off. There might even be a required quota of fares you must carry to keep your job.  \r\n\r\nYou will also have to be hired as an employee. You won't be able to just download the app, fill out everything, photograph your license, plate, car, face, and insurance information, then wait for the back ground check, you'll have to apply, wait for an interview, then wait to be contacted. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, your pay will not be equal to your work. You might be payed based on an average of the amount of rides any particular driver sells in a given shift, but that's all you get no matter how many more than that average you pick up.If your boss decides to reward you, maybe you'll get a raise or bonus, just like if you kiss a lot of ass at Walmart or Amazon. In Evansville Indiana, you might be offered $13 an hour before taxes are taken out, and you'll take it or leave it. Delivery drivers get tipped, so you'll get less. You might get $7.25 and be told to be greatful, because tipped workers do not have to be given minimum wage, and your boss has been gracious enough to give that to you anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, I think a lot of you are counting on that $15 minimum wage to save you. I don't see that happening, but if it does, it won't save you. It'll just mean that you have to work for the largest companies around. Nothing smaller than a full sized conglomerate will survive without quickly rushing to mechanize everything and downsizing workers as well as outsourcing to countries with much lower minimum wages. Did you know, 9/11 has been outsourced in many places. You, for the time being, are transfered to an operator here in the United States before being connected back to your local emergency services, so the time you speak to a call center employee is short, and they do speak your language enough to understand you even if you are panicking, or maybe even injured yourself and seconds from death, but what if that changes? \r\n\r\nYou might have an emergency, dial 9/11, and hear a thickly accented voice say, \"Thank you for calling nine one one, how may I help you today,\" and you'll have to relay not only your address but the city, state, and the zipcode and possibly repeat it a few times. If you are on the side of the road somewhere, the operator will still need something to input in to the computer before they can transfer you to the right personel in your area, so you might just be screwed.\r\nCalifornia has given special treatment to Uber and Lyft, but will that spill over to the whole country if this is federalized? What about Grubhub, Doordash, Roadie, etc? There's no way of knowing what this administration will do, and many of you voted for Joe Biden, because at least he isn't Donald Trump. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember the bad ol orange man saying anything negative about the gig economy.",

                "text": "“Employees’ lunches are their personal property and the company is not responsible for lost or stolen personal items.”Nobody likes a lunch thief, and I had one of the most aggressive at my office. \n\nThere were rumors for a few months leading up to the inciting incident of someone going around and taking peoples’ lunches. Just about every day someone different would complain that their lunch was missing. \n\nIt even happened to me once or twice, but I figured hey, it’s a big office, a few people are probably just careless and grab the wrong lunch and are too embarrassed to bring it back or someone else packs their lunch and they don’t know what’s in there so it’s not obvious they have the wrong one, or whatever. \n\nMost people just brought brown bags with their names on it anyways, or identical Rubbermaid Tupperware with a little piece of labeled tape on the side. It was easy enough to mix it up. \n\nI had accidentally grabbed a wrong lunch once or twice, but I’d noticed before I got it open. I thought I was just more careful, or even just not as busy, as some other people in the building. \n\nHowever, other people weren’t as forgiving, and a quorum made complaints to HR. They were blown off. Personally, at the time, I thought it was all much ado about nothing. \n\nBut then it began. My wife enrolled in a French cooking class online and just about every day I was bringing fancy gourmand leftovers in for lunch. You’d think I was picking up a to go bag from a Michelin starred bistro on the way in each morning, she really threw herself into the coursework.\n\nThere were no problems for about two weeks, maybe three, until one day my lunch went missing. Considering what delicacies I had to look forward to I was pretty miffed, but I did a once over around the break room and didn’t see anyone eating my lunch so figured someone grabbed my bag by accident earlier, saw how good things looked and—realizing it was their lucky day—didn’t bring it back to the fridge. \n\nI wrote the mysterious stranger off as an asshole but accepted the loss and looked forward to dinner that night instead. \n\nNext day I write my name on my lunch in extra bold lettering, jam the bag into the back of the fridge, and feel peace of mind. I get there come break time, nope, it’s gone. \n\nI was pretty upset, but I figured it was a stroke of bad luck, and left it at that. What else could I do?\n\nHowever, third day, out of an abundance of caution, I kept my lunch at my desk. A pain, because I had to eat it fairly early in the day to avoid spoilage, but at least I’d know where it was. \n\nI got up to take care of some business down the hall and when I came back… yep, my lunch was gone.\n\nUnfortunately that didn’t help me narrow it down much at all because my desk is centrally located so everyone’s constantly passing by. \n\nAt that point there was no possibility of the theft being arbitrary, so I approached HR and filed a complaint. Their response, practically verbatim, was, “Employees’ lunches are their personal property and the company is not responsible for lost or stolen personal items.”\n\nThe following day my wife packed a cream based soup that really had to be refrigerated. I was passing by the break room to check on my lunch practically every five minutes. Somehow it still managed to disappear. \n\nI was irate at this point and returned to HR and really blew my top. The best they could do was send a memo around about remembering to check the name on your lunch when you remove it from the fridge, but they made very clear that it was a routine memo and in no way related to my complaints, which were not their jurisdiction, so not an admission of responsibility, because my lunch was my own personal problem. \n\nThe only suitable alternative to packing a lunch available in the building are these wretched shrink wrapped ham and cheese sandwiches from a vending machine. \n\nThey’ve been marinating in the heat for God knows how long and the bread is as stale as cork board and the meat is rancid and there’s gluey mayo smushed into the center. It’s a relic of the old office tenants’ I’m pretty sure. \n\nI vented daily to my wife but her only idea was to start bringing a regular sandwich and apple again to dissuade the thief and get him to move on to other lunches. \n\nSo, determined prevent this low life scum from downgrading the quality of my lunch, I hatched an elaborate plan… Then the pandemic hit and I forgot all about this whole saga. \n\nI worked remotely for months and months. Then we returned, and after all that had happened globally, this was the last thing on my mind. \n\nBut I got to the break room the first day back, frustrated from having to wear a button up and tie after months of working in pajamas, sore from my desk chair, and exhausted from small talk, only to find… my lunch was gone. \n\nThis was a particularly sore point because my wife and I divorced between my last lunch and work and the present one. So I did not appreciate being reminded of any past threads involving her. \n\nI pretty much flew into a blind rage at that point. Especially seeing that stupid worthless memo about checking the lunch bag names posted in the break room, feeling so helpless and so hungry and so alone as it was me and my lunch against the world. \n\nI stormed out and was determined to return the next day with a plan. \n\nSo, I came in the following day… with an empty lunch bag. \n\nAnd I checked closely to be sure no one was watching and… I switched the contents of the HR person’s lunch bag into my bag. So now their lunch appeared to be my lunch. \n\nThey’d packed a regular brown bag, so I just discarded that, and I left, and I waited. I knew this was a pretty big gamble because it was contingent on the theory that the thief was avoiding me while having lunch, but not wary of anyone else. So would eat out in the open if there were no risk of bumping into me. \n\nSo I made a big show of going around the office announcing that I was headed out for a meeting and I wouldn’t be back until at least 3:00pm.\n\nI even went to the trouble of moving my car out of the lot to a space two streets over. Where I then sat in my car and worked remotely for several hours before sneaking\ninto the building up the back stairway.\n\nI then sat in the stairwell just outside the break room, where you can hear chatter can’t be seen, and after about 20-30 minutes of waiting, I heard it. \n\nThe sweetest sound I’ll ever hear in the office. \n\n(HR) “What the heck Kyle, that’s my lunch.” \n\n\n(Lunch thief!!) “Nah, it’s not your name on the bag.”\n\n(HR) Give me that! \n\n*I’m assuming grabs bag and sees my name.*\n\n(HR) Yah, let’s head to my office for a chat. \n\nThe HR rep later called me in as well and said they were “aware of my break room hijinks,” but it was obvious that the point still came across loud and clear. \n\nThey warned me that it was a violation of policy to move another employee’s lunch—it took every ounce of self control for me to keep from retorting “I thought our lunches were our personal property and the company was not responsible for them being lost or stolen?” \n\nThey informed me they’d located the thief and things would be handled accordingly. \n\nBut better than whatever write up they might be able to issue Kyle, his reveal as the lunch thief occurred in front of the whole break room. So word quickly spread as to who had been stealing everyone’s lunches earlier last year and he is now the office pariah. \n\nHe was in line for a promotion. The promotion is indefinitely off the table. \n\nAnd I also earned brownie points for exposing him, though more than I’m satisfied with are being attributed to HR. \n\nAt the end of the day though, I didn’t do this for this credit, or even the sweet sweet *sweet* revenge. I did it to get my lunches back.",

The context here, from what I gather, is that the employees are trying to unionize. \n\nManagement there is filled with pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps type folks that think the admittedly good ESOP (that used to be way better) is worth living a life of poverty wages for. Winco gets a lot of good press for being an employee owned company but I don’t think that’s fair—it’s exactly as garbage as any retail experience and pays about as much. And I can’t even describe how shocked I was when I left and was treated like an adult for the first time in the workplace. \n\nWinCo hides behind its employee owned status, but make no mistake the employees have zero say in anything. There are committees that are constantly overruled by corporate whenever they try to advocate for themselves. And as you can see here, management isn’t above intimidation and bullying. \n\nGood luck to the folks still working there and I hope they find peace in the hell world we live in.",

This shouldn't be happening.\n\nI just ask members to understand that when we ask you the same things every other week, it's not because we want to, we're told to.

                "text": "I emailed a Valve employee about CS:GO (and got a response!)**Heres my initial email:**\n> Dear John McDonald,\n\n>I recently watched your talk at GDC 2018 about deep learning in CS:GO (which was great by the way) and I have a few questions of my own.\n\n>A recent update came out to CS:GO which changed a variable in the game files which broke nearly all aim and vision assistance cheats, which i'm sure you are aware of. **My question is: is it possible to change other variables during updates to repeat that effect?** Using this, or a similar, method would certainly deter cheaters and potentially work as an anti cheat. That said i'm not sure how that would effect server and client interaction, as there is probably a reason this hasn't been done already.\n\n>One of the questions at the conference talked about checking if a person really made the mouse movement and if they really are in total control of their player. **I was curious about, if using a learning program, you could track the speed of a players crosshair before taking a shot?** and using that, judge their accuracy and how straight of a line a player makes when flicking. Using a method like this could help detect aimbots because it is nearly impossible to make a completely straight line without external assistance, and doing that in milliseconds would be even harder. **If this is possible would it also be possible to use a modified version of it to detect wallhacks (seeing how close a players crosshair is to an enemy through a wall)?**\n\n>**Why is the report function unavailable in demos and watching live matches?** Being able to report players while having all the benefits of GOTV (xray and pov) would potentially increase the accuracy of player reports. Although I do see how it could be abused by cheaters using report bots. **Tied to this question, do reports through Steam do anything relevant to CS:GO?** (pressing report in a live game/ demo brings you to the players Steam profile.) \n\n>**What is your/Valve's opinion on partnering with 3rd party matchmaking services like FACEIT and ESEA?** Doing so could benefit both parties by having 128 tick matchmaking servers, as well as another anticheat, which could lead to older players who stopped playing because of those problems to come back, and new players coming to CS:GO because of those features.\n\n>**How much do you/the CS:GO dev team read feedback?** As replies from you guys in the subreddit are sparse.\n\n>All of my questions are in bold, the surrounding text is context and further explanation for the questions. Please pardon my bad explaining skills as well.\n\n>Your talk really inspired me to do more Overwatch cases and be overall a more active member of the community so thanks for that.\n\n>-MrLeJosh\n\n**His response:**\n>Changing variables is feasible, but it’s just a little treadmill. It breaks cheats for a small amount of time to work around but requires a fair amount of work on our side. That’s typically a bad tradeoff to make.\n\n>The learner we use tracks velocity of the view angles already—that’s one of the main things it is looking at. It’s not intuitively clear what a wall hack looks for.\n\n>I don’t have a well-formed opinion on third party matchmaking services. At first blush, it seems like they provide value to our mutual customers, which is great.\n\n>We read the feedback sent to the feedback alias, although there are times where the volume is too large for us to read every piece of mail sent.\n\n \n>Cheers,\n\n\n>McJohn\n\n(I shrunk down spaces between paragraphs so this post isn't *too* long)\n\nObviously John didn't answer all my questions fully, which I assume was due to Valve not wanting to release info on certain topics.\n\nI am sharing this in case anyone else had these questions, and to enlighten those who have been skeptical on Valves presence in CS:GO. (including me)\n\nIf you want to watch the GDC conference it is available [here](https://youtu.be/ObhK8lUfIlc)\n\nI asked John McDonald for permission to post this. (He said yes in case you weren't sure.)\n\n\nEDIT: I had a great time in this thread, I read nearly everyone's comments and replied to as many as I could. John even replied to a comment! I hope this thread helped out some people who were hazy/weary about the state of anticheat in CS:GO.",

The suspects are accused of impersonating homeless people at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and using their names to illegally get their pandemic benefits. Some of those homeless people died during the pandemic. The suspects include five Department of Homeless services workers, as well as employees of the NYPD, MTA, USPS and NYCHA. Prosecutors believe they are responsible for obtaining nearly $1.2 million in fraudulent benefits between April 2020 and October 2021. Officials say approximately 170 people had their identities stolen. It is alleged that the five DHS employees got shelter resident information from paper and digital files and shared them with the group. \"Stealing the identities of New Yorkers, many of them homeless, and defrauding a critical social safety program during one of the most challenging times in our city's history is downright shameful and we allege criminal,\" said District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Prosecutors say they were looking into a DHS employee who may have been manufacturing ghost guns when investigators discovered the other alleged fraud. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty on Thursday and the judge set bail for almost every suspect.#nyc #fraud #news ",
